Maintenance-only as of Jan 2009
-------------------------------

No further development for the kde4 tray icon, because the X11 Trayicon Specification
seems to be really ugly and there are people from both of the bigger desktop environments (gnome,kde)
that predict no future for that specification.

Additionaly both environments have 'replacements' that are more powerful.


Successors:
For gnome2.22+: panel-applet
For kde4.1+   : plasmoid
Other desktops: not supported
