You can assign remote descriptors to drivers respectively to load that
descriptor when a receiver - using the driver - is plugged in.
For every remote descriptor you can specify which desktop profiles to load.
This is the purpose of loader files.

Every entry in a loader file is separated by a newline and
except ALL represent filenames. 
ALL is a special entry that cause liriexec to load all desktop entries.
Has to be the first line. If ALL is set all further entries are ignored.

Example Entries:
--------
ALL
